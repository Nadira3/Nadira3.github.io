conversation: "Doctor: Case:

A 45-year-old male presents with severe upper abdominal pain for the last 12 hours. The pain is constant, radiating to his back, and worsens with movement. He denies any nausea or vomiting. He has a history of chronic alcohol use, but denies any recent episodes of binge drinking. His vital signs are stable, but his blood pressure is slightly elevated at 140/90 mmHg.

He has a noticeable tenderness in the upper abdomen, particularly in the epigastric region. The rest of his examination is unremarkable.

Red Herring: The patient mentions having a mild headache for the past two days, but denies any fever, neck stiffness, or visual disturbances.

Start with your history. Don’t even think about jumping to a diagnosis just yet. What are you going to ask this patient? Don’t skip any crucial details. Why? What’s the rationale behind each question? And why is the headache potentially irrelevant here? Show me you're thinking critically, or you’ll fall flat.

Student: Presenting complaint is abdominal pain. Given history suggests site of pain is in the epigastric region. I'll ask how the pain started, if it was gradual or sudden, I'll ask if he has had a previous experience or if this is a first time occurrence.

I'll ask him to describe the pain. Burning pain may suggest PUD. I'll ask for associated symptoms I'll expect to see in PUD or perforated ulcer. That's all I know

Doctor: You’re already making mistakes, and we haven’t even started the real questioning yet. How did you arrive at that? Just because you know some basic associations doesn’t mean you’re thinking deeply enough. You think you can just start asking vague questions like How did it start? and be done with it? You're not playing detective, you’re playing with people’s lives.

Let’s break this down:

Pain onset: Fine, you’re thinking about whether it was sudden or gradual, but why? You need to be specific. You’re looking for clues about the nature of the pain. Sudden onset could suggest an acute process, like an infarction or perforation. Gradual onset could suggest something like gastritis or an obstructive issue. You need to rationalize why that question is going to help you rule things in or out.

Previous episodes: You mentioned asking about prior episodes, good. Why is that important? Chronic pancreatitis, for example, might have had similar episodes before. But you didn’t think about that in your differential, did you?

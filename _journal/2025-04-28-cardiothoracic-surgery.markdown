Case Study: Chest Trauma(Gunshot Wound)

## Case 1: Chest Trauma – Gunshot Wound to the Chest
**Patient:** Adult male with penetrating chest trauma from a firearm.

### Key History Details
- **Type of firearm:** High‑velocity (rifle) vs. low‑velocity (handgun).
  - High‑velocity often produces entry and exit wounds → cavitation → more tissue damage.
- **Distance of shot:** Approximate in meters; closer range ↑ kinetic energy transfer.
- **Direction of shot:** Anterior vs. posterior; determines trajectory and injured structures.
- **Number of shots:** Single vs. multiple entry/exit tracks.

### Entry vs. Exit Wounds
| Feature             | Entry Wound                        | Exit Wound                                     |
|---------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Diameter            | Smaller; abrasion collar present   | Larger; everted margins                         |
| Edge appearance     | Inverted                          | Everted                                         |
| Tissue cavitation   | Internal cavitation zone             | Less pronounced cavitation                     |
| Interpretation      | Point of bullet impact             | Point of bullet exit                           |

> **Clinical tip:** Always measure wound dimensions (length × width × depth) to compare entry vs. exit.

## Initial Examination
1. **Penetrating chest injury**: Inspect for entry/exit wounds, crepitus, subcutaneous emphysema.
2. **Bleeding assessment**:
   - **Volume estimation** (qualitative):
     - Was clothing soaked? “Shirt soaked with blood?”
     - Presence of large clots? Reports of dizziness/syncope?
     - **Anemic signs** (tachycardia, pallor, orthostatic hypotension) suggest >20% blood loss.

3. **Chest wall deformity**: Flail segments, paradoxical motion.
4. **Airway & breathing**: Stridor, breath sounds, tracheal deviation.
5. **Circulation**: Pulse, blood pressure, capillary refill.

## Mechanism (MIST Mnemonic)
| **M** – Mechanism    | Firearm type, distance (m), direction, number of shots |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **I** – Injuries     | Penetrating wounds, pulmonary contusion, hematoma, pneumothorax |
| **S** – Signs        | Vitals, bleeding severity, hemoptysis, crepitus, deformity |
| **T** – Treatment    | Prehospital care, chest tube, surgical interventions   |

| **Crushing**                 | Direct compressive force                     | Rib fracture under heavy object       |
| **Compression**              | Sustained pressure over time                 | Seatbelt injury                       |
| **Acceleration–Deceleration**| Rapid change in velocity → shearing forces   | Whiplash                              |

| **Contusion**                | Blunt trauma → capillary rupture             | Pulmonary contusion                   |
| **Penetrating**              | Object pierces tissue                        | Gunshot wound                         |

## Pulmonary Contusion
**Definition:** Bleeding into alveolar spaces without lung laceration.

### Pathophysiology (Relating to GSW)
1. **Shockwave from bullet** → shear forces rupture alveolar capillaries.
2. **Blood** extravasates into interstitium and alveoli.
3. **Edema & hemorrhage** → ↓ lung compliance, ↓ gas exchange.
4. **Inflammatory response** → cytokine release, further capillary leak.
5. **Ventilation–perfusion mismatch** → hypoxia.

### Clinical Recognition
- **Hemoptysis:** Blood-streaked sputum from cough.
- **Respiratory distress:** Tachypnea, dyspnea, hypoxia.
- **Auscultation:** Crackles at injury site.

## Pulmonary Hematoma
**Definition:** Localized collection of blood in lung parenchyma with tissue laceration.
- **Signs:** Dullness on percussion, localized reduced breath sounds, consolidation on imaging.

---

## Hissing Sound & Subcutaneous Emphysema
- **Cause:** Air leak from lung/pleura → tracks into subcutaneous tissue.
- **Clinical hint:** Feels like Rice Krispies under skin; indicates pneumothorax or bronchial injury.

## Case 2: Stab Wound with Neck Drain

### Drains
**Definition:** Hollow tube to remove air/fluid from wound or cavity.

| Type            | Example       | Mechanism             | Scenario                                  |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Passive         | Penrose       | Gravity-dependent     | Superficial abscess drainage              |
| Active          | Jackson‑Pratt | Bulb suction          | Post-thyroidectomy hematoma prevention    |
| Closed Suction  | Hemovac       | Controlled negative pressure | Neck hematoma evacuation post-trauma |

**Characteristics:** Malleable, biocompatible, non-carcinogenic, radiopaque marker.

**Indications:**
- **Therapeutic:** Evacuate hemothorax to re-expand lung.
- **Diagnostic:** Identify chyle leak (milky fluid) after thoracic duct injury.
- **Prophylactic:** Prevent seroma after mastectomy.

**Removal Criteria:**
- Effluent <30 mL/24 h and serous.
- Imaging confirms cavity collapse.

**Drain Mechanisms:**
- **Gravity:** Penrose draining dependent fluid.
- **Suction:** JP/Hemovac applying negative pressure to draw fluid.

> **Never close a gunshot wound primarily** – risk of retained debris, infection, and tension from trapped air/blood. Case example: Mediastinal abscess developed post-primary closure, requiring re-opening and surgical drainage.

---

## Wound Classification
- **Tidy:** Clean, minimal tissue loss (e.g., knife stab).
- **Untidy:** Ragged, contaminated (e.g., blast injury).
- **Indeterminate:** Unknown depth/contamination; explore and debride.

---

## Chest Injury Classification
1. **By Mechanism:** Blunt vs. Penetrating.
2. **By Location:** Chest wall vs. Intrathoracic (heart, vessels, airways, diaphragm).
3. **Deadly Dozen:**

   - **Hidden Six:** Pulmonary contusion; Cardiac contusion; Esophageal injury; Tracheobronchial injury; Diaphragmatic rupture; Aortic injury.

---

## Emergency Management of Lethal Conditions
- **Airway obstruction:** Cricothyroidotomy/tracheostomy.
- **Tension pneumothorax vs. Cardiac tamponade:**

| Obstructive      | Physical obstruction to blood flow                  | Cardiac tamponade; pulmonary embolism|
| Distributive     | Maldistribution of blood (↓ SVR)                    | Septic; neurogenic; anaphylactic     |
| Cardiogenic      | ↓ myocardial contractility                          | MI; cardiomyopathy                  |

Case Study: Intussusception

---

## **1. Case Study: Intussusception**

### Presentation
- **Intermittent, inconsolable crying** → Suggests colicky pain from intermittent telescoping
- **High-pitched cry** → CNS irritation (possible systemic sepsis or late-stage complication)
- **Flank fullness** → Consider **horseshoe kidney** as differential

---

## **2. Intussusception**

### Epidemiology
- Most common cause of intestinal obstruction in children aged **3 – 36 months**
- Peak incidence: **4 - 10 months**

### Etiology
- **90% idiopathic** (likely Peyer’s patch hyperplasia post-viral)
- **Lead points** (in older children): Meckel’s diverticulum, lymphoma, polyp, Henoch-Schönlein purpura

### Classic Triad
- **Intermittent abdominal pain**
- **Vomiting**
- **Red currant jelly stool** (blood + mucus)

---

## **3. Oncology Branch-Off: Chemotherapy & Wound Healing**

### When to start chemo if wound is present?
- **After wound has healed**

### Why?
- Chemotherapeutic agents like vincristine, actinomycin, doxorubicin, etoposide:
  - Inhibit fibroblast proliferation
  - Impair angiogenesis
  - Delay healing
  - Increase infection risk

### Chemotherapy Protocols

| Tumor Type | Drugs |
|------------|-------|
| General Wilms | Vincristine + Actinomycin D |
| Focal Disease | Add **Doxorubicin** |
| Diffuse/Advanced Disease | Use **Etoposide** |

---

## **4. Embryopathogenesis of Hypospadias**

### Pathophysiology
- Urethral folds fail to fuse along the ventral penis
- Result: abnormal urethral opening (glans, shaft, scrotum)
- Driven by **↓ DHT** or **androgen insensitivity**

### Associated anomalies:
- **Chordee** (ventral curvature)
- **Cryptorchidism** → Consider DSD screen

---

## **5. Scar Types: Hypertrophic vs Keloid**

| Feature | Hypertrophic | Keloid |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| Growth | Confined to wound | Extends beyond |
| Onset | Within weeks | Often months |
| Spontaneous regression | Common | Rare |
| Recurrence | Less common | High recurrence rate |
| Malignant potential | None | **Rare sarcomatous transformation** |

### Mnemonic:
- **Keloid = Kraken** → Tentacles grow beyond boundaries
- **Hypertrophic = Humble** → Obeys the wound line

---

## **6. Components of Autonomic Neuropathy**

| System | Manifestations |
|--------|----------------|
| Cardiovascular | Orthostatic hypotension, resting tachycardia |
| Gastrointestinal | Gastroparesis, constipation, diarrhea |
| Genitourinary | Bladder retention, overflow incontinence, erectile dysfunction |
| Sudomotor | Anhidrosis, gustatory sweating |
| Pupils | Sluggish light reflex, Argyll Robertson pupil-like responses |

### Mnemonic Scene:
> A puppet controlled by the ANS has its strings snipped:  
> - Heart swings wildly  
> - Gut stalls  
> - Bladder leaks  
> - Skin dries  
> - Pupils dim

> 2. Explain the embryologic cause of his hypospadias.  
> 3. Should you screen for cryptorchidism?

# Consultant Challenge Response

## **Case Summary:**
A patient post-nephrectomy, currently healing a surgical wound, is being considered for **Vincristine** chemotherapy. The same patient has **hypospadias**, and the question arises whether to **screen for cryptorchidism**.

---

## **1. Justify or Refute Use of Vincristine Post-Operatively**

### **Refute: Premature Initiation of Chemotherapy**

#### **Reasoning:**
Vincristine is a cytotoxic agent that:
- Inhibits **microtubule formation**, affecting **mitosis**
- Suppresses **fibroblast activity** and **angiogenesis**
- Leads to **delayed wound healing** and increased risk of **dehiscence or infection**

#### **Surgical Principle:**
> *"Never start cytotoxic therapy until the wound bed has healed — clean, dry, and epithelialized."*

#### **Clinical Standard:**
- Wait **10–14 days minimum** post-op (or until wound is stable) before initiating chemotherapy.

#### **Conclusion:**
Starting Vincristine before complete wound healing is **contraindicated**. It increases risk of wound breakdown and systemic complications.

---

## **2. Embryologic Cause of Hypospadias**

### **Normal Development:**
- During weeks **8–14 of gestation**, **urethral folds** fuse on the **ventral aspect of the penis**, forming the penile urethra.
- This fusion is driven by **dihydrotestosterone (DHT)** via **5α-reductase** activation.

### **In Hypospadias:**
- **Urethral fold fusion fails** → Urethral meatus opens **proximally** on the glans, shaft, or perineum.
- May be associated with **ventral chordee** (fibrous tethering)

### **Pathogenesis Factors:**
- ↓ DHT production or action
- 5α-reductase deficiency
- Androgen receptor insensitivity
- Endocrine disruptors (e.g., phthalates, DES)

---

## **3. Should You Screen for Cryptorchidism?**

### **Yes — Absolutely.**

#### **Justification:**
- Hypospadias is often part of a spectrum of **Disorders of Sex Development (DSDs)**.
- The co-occurrence of **hypospadias + cryptorchidism** → strong signal for **underlying intersex condition** or **gonadal dysgenesis**

### **Action Plan:**
- Perform **bilateral testicular palpation**
- If non-palpable → Order **USS/CT/MRI**
- Consider **karyotype analysis** and **hormonal studies** (LH, FSH, testosterone, AMH)

#### **Red Flag:**
> A child with **proximal hypospadias and undescended testes** MUST be evaluated for DSD. Delay in recognition = legal and clinical liability.

---

## **Final Verdict:**
| Issue | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Chemo initiation | Delay until wound heals |
| Hypospadias cause | Urethral fold fusion failure (↓DHT) |
| Cryptorchidism screen | Mandatory — to rule out DSD |

---

> **Consultant Summary:**  
> "If you poison the wound before it's sealed, you own the breakdown. And if you miss a DSD, you don't deserve to touch another child again. Tighten up, doctor."

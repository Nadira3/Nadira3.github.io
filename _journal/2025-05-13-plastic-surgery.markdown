## I. Concept Digestion

### 1. Differentiation of Ulcer Types

| Feature              | Venous Ulcer                        | Arterial Ulcer                      | Lymphatic Ulcer                    | Malignant Ulcer                             |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Location             | Medial malleolus (gaiter area)      | Toes, heels, pressure points        | Dorsum of foot                      | Anywhere, esp. chronic ulcer sites           |
| Appearance           | Shallow, irregular, granulating     | Punched out, deep, necrotic         | Shallow, oozing                     | Raised, everted edges, necrotic base         |
| Pain                 | Mild, relieved by elevation         | Severe, worse on elevation          | Mild to moderate                    | Painless or neuropathic pain                 |
| Surrounding Skin     | Hemosiderin deposits, eczema        | Cold, hairless, shiny               | Thickened, hyperkeratotic          | Indurated, pigmented, satellite nodules      |
| Pulses               | Present                             | Absent/Reduced                      | Normal                              | May be normal or reduced                     |
| Discharge            | Serous or purulent                  | Minimal                             | Proteinaceous lymph                 | Bloody, foul-smelling                        |
| Other Signs          | Varicose veins                      | Claudication, rest pain, gangrene   | Lymphedema, peau d’orange          | Regional nodes, systemic signs               |

## III. Clinical/Applied Simulation – Consultant Round

> **Consultant:** "You’re reviewing a leg ulcer—defaulting to 'venous' without thinking? That’s amateur. Walk me through your reasoning. I’ll fail fluff."

**You (student):**
- **Pain**: Is it worse on walking (arterial) or relieved by elevation (venous)?
- **Location**: Medial ankle (venous) vs toes/heel (arterial)?
- **Edges**: Irregular = venous, punched out = arterial, everted = malignant.
- **Discharge**: Serous vs lymph-rich vs bloody/foul?
- **Pulses**: Check all – absent is arterial clue.
- **Systemic features**: Weight loss, fever? Think malignancy.

**Consultant:** "You missed ulcer age, prior trauma, neuropathy, and lymphadenopathy. You want to be a surgeon? Redo it in SOAP."

## VI. Monitoring Skin Flap Viability

| Parameter         | Interpretation                                     |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Color             | Pink = good, Pale = ischemia, Blue = congestion    |
| Cap Refill        | Normal <2s, delayed = ischemia                     |
| Temperature       | Cool = ischemic, compare with adjacent skin        |
| Bleeding Edge     | Presence = good perfusion                          |
| Area of Discoloration | Progression = poor perfusion                    |

---

## VII. Why Not Graft Over Medial Malleolus?

- **Grafts require granulation tissue** – bone/tendon exposure = fail
- **Flaps bring their own blood supply**
- Better durability, contouring over pressure zones
- Higher success rates in ischemic or infected beds

---

## VIII. Why Use Hb, Not PCV, for Surgical Planning?

| Reason              | Explanation                                       |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Hb = O₂ carrying power | Direct measure of oxygen transport             |
| PCV misleads         | Affected by hydration status                    |
| Acute blood loss     | PCV lags behind, Hb reflects real deficit        |
| Volume status shift  | PCV rises with dehydration falsely              |

> **Consultant:** "Stop quoting PCV like it’s gospel. Hb tells you if your patient will bleed out or breathe post-op. PCV is for clerks, not surgeons."

---

## IX. Pre-Operative Investigations

| Crossmatch           | Prepare for transfusion                         |
| HIV/HBV/HCV          | Status, theatre risk, consent implications      |
| Chest function tests | Indicated in COPD/asthma patients               |

|                | - Do you smoke or have diabetes/hypertension?                                                            |
| **Lymphatic**   | - Do you have a long-standing swelling of the limb?                                                     |
|                | - Any history of recurrent cellulitis?                                                                   |

# XI. Simulation – The Angry Consultant

**Consultant:**  
"Why the hell would you say 'venous' without asking about claudication? If that patient has rest pain and you slap a compression bandage on them, you’re writing the amputation request. Again—what. specific. history. question. rules out malignancy?"

**Expected Student Response:**  
"Chronicity, foul discharge, and progressive change in size or bleeding are suspicious. Ask about lymphadenopathy, prior trauma, and systemic signs like weight loss."

**Consultant:**  
"Better. But if you don’t examine *pulses* and don’t biopsy a suspicious ulcer—you deserve your malpractice suit. Next!"

|-------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **F**       | **Flush of Color**     | Pink = good, Pale = ischemia, Dusky = venous congestion     |

# OSCE-Style Flash Drills – Ulcer, NF, Flap Viability

## STATION 1: Ulcer Diagnosis

**Scenario**:  
A 60-year-old man presents with a 6-month history of a non-healing ulcer over the medial malleolus.

**Q1:** What is the most likely cause?  
**A:** Venous ulcer.

**Q2:** What history supports this?  
**A:** Chronicity, location (gaiter area), worse with standing, relief with leg elevation, hx of varicose veins.

**Q3:** What examination signs do you look for?  
**A:** Hemosiderin staining, lipodermatosclerosis, varicose veins, edema, warm skin, granulating base.

**Consultant Critique:**  
*“If you didn’t check pulses before applying compression—you've just necrosed the leg. Always rule out arterial disease!”*

---

## STATION 2: Rule Out Arterial Ulcer

**Scenario**:  
Same patient. You suspect arterial involvement.

**Q1:** What symptoms point to arterial ulcers?  
**A:** Intermittent claudication, rest pain, cool skin, reduced/absent pulses, ulcers on pressure points like toes.

**Q2:** What test confirms your suspicion?  
**A:** Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI). <0.9 suggests arterial insufficiency.

**Consultant Critique:**  
*"ABI first. Doppler next. If you don't check this before compression, you're committing iatrogenic murder."*

---

## STATION 3: Neurofibromatosis History Taking

**Scenario**:  
A 25-year-old male presents with multiple skin swellings and pigmentation.

**Q1:** What system-based history must you ask?  
**A:**  
- Neuro: seizures, headaches, learning disability  
- Derm: onset and change in lesions, pruritus  
- Ortho: bone pain, scoliosis  
- Eyes: vision issues, Lisch nodules  
- FHx: family members with similar signs

**Q2:** What’s your provisional diagnosis?  
**A:** Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1)

**Q3:** What features meet NIH criteria?  
**A:** ≥2 of:  
- ≥6 café-au-lait spots  
- Axillary/inguinal freckling  
- ≥2 neurofibromas or 1 plexiform  
- Optic glioma  
- ≥2 Lisch nodules  
- Osseous lesions (e.g., sphenoid dysplasia)  
- First-degree relative with NF1

**Consultant Critique:**  
*"If you didn't screen for learning disabilities or optic issues, you've missed 40% of the complications. Unacceptable."*

---

## STATION 4: Skin Flap Monitoring Post-Op

**Scenario**:  
Post-op day 1 following flap coverage of a medial malleolus wound.

**Q1:** What 5 things must be monitored hourly?  
**A:**  
- Color  
- Temperature  
- Capillary refill  
- Edge bleeding  
- Doppler signal

**Q2:** What’s an early sign of venous congestion?  
**A:** Purple/dusky color with brisk bleeding

**Q3:** How would you test arterial flow?  
**A:** Doppler signal and capillary refill <2s.

**Consultant Critique:**  
*"Monitoring is your life insurance. If you miss duskiness, necrosis is next. Flaps don’t forgive mistakes."*

---

## STATION 5: Graft vs Flap

**Scenario**:  
You're deciding between a skin graft and a flap over the medial malleolus.

**Q1:** Why not a graft here?  
**A:** Poor vascularity on bony prominence, lack of granulation tissue, exposed tendon/bone.

**Q2:** What advantages does a flap offer?  
**A:** Brings its own blood supply, better for coverage of poorly vascularized tissue, more durable.

**Mnemonic Recap:**  
**Battle at Malleolus Fortress** – Grafts need fertile fields; Flaps bring blood and army.

**Consultant Critique:**  
*"If you slap a graft on bone, it’s like planting seeds on rock—don’t waste the theatre time."*

---

## STATION 6: PCV vs Hb – Surgical Fitness

**Scenario**:  
Pre-op anemia screen for a patient with a chronic ulcer needing skin coverage.

**Q1:** Why is Hb better than PCV?  
**A:**  
- Hb measures oxygen-carrying capacity directly  
- PCV is volume-based, affected by hydration status

**Q2:** What’s a misleading situation where PCV fails?  
**A:** Dehydration (false high PCV, normal Hb) or fluid overload (false low PCV).

**Consultant Critique:**  
*"Rely on PCV alone and you might cut into a hypoxic patient. Use Hb—end of discussion."*

---

## STATION 7: Pre-op Investigations – Interpretation

**Scenario**:  
You’re screening a patient for elective flap surgery.

**Investigations & Purpose:**

| Investigation     | Purpose                                                   |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| FBC               | Anemia, leukocytosis (infection), platelet count          |
| U&E               | Electrolyte balance, renal function (anesthesia safety)   |
| RBS/FBS           | Diabetic control, wound healing potential                 |
| ECG               | Cardiac fitness for anesthesia                            |
| Coagulation Panel | Bleeding risk (esp. important for flap survival)         |
| HIV/Hep B/C       | Infection risk, immunosuppression                         |
| Chest X-Ray       | Pulmonary evaluation if age/comorbidity suggestive        |

**Consultant Critique:**  
*"Surgery is controlled trauma. If you don’t evaluate the battlefield—don’t enter it."*

# Anki Flashcards – OSCE: Ulcers, Neurofibromatosis, Flaps

---

**Q:** What is the most likely cause of a chronic ulcer over the medial malleolus?  
**A:** Venous ulcer.

---

**Q:** What history supports a diagnosis of venous ulcer?  
**A:** Chronicity, gaiter area location, worsens on standing, improves with elevation, hx of varicose veins.

---

**Q:** What physical signs support venous ulcers?  
**A:** Hemosiderin staining, lipodermatosclerosis, edema, varicosities, warm granulating ulcer base.

---

**Q:** What must you rule out before applying compression therapy in venous ulcer?  
**A:** Arterial insufficiency (via pulse exam and ABI).

---

**Q:** What symptoms point to an arterial ulcer?  
**A:** Claudication, rest pain, cool skin, diminished/absent pulses, ulcer on toes or pressure points.

---

**Q:** What is the most useful bedside test for arterial disease?  
**A:** Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI); <0.9 indicates arterial insufficiency.

---

**Q:** What 7 system-based questions must you ask when evaluating a patient for Neurofibromatosis?  
**A:**  
1. Seizures  
2. Headaches  
3. Vision changes  
4. Learning difficulty  
5. Skin lesion history  
6. Bone pain/deformity  
7. Family history of similar lesions

---

**Q:** What are the NIH diagnostic criteria for NF1 (name 4 out of 7)?  
**A:**  
- ≥6 café-au-lait spots  
- Axillary/inguinal freckling  
- ≥2 neurofibromas or 1 plexiform  
- Optic glioma  
- ≥2 Lisch nodules  
- Osseous lesions  
- 1st-degree relative with NF1

---

**Q:** What five parameters should be monitored post-operatively in a skin flap?  
**A:**  
1. Color  
2. Capillary refill  
3. Temperature  
4. Edge bleeding  
5. Doppler signal

---

**Q:** What early sign indicates venous congestion in a flap?  
**A:** Dusky/purple color with brisk bleeding on needle prick.

---

**Q:** Why is a flap preferred over a graft in wounds over the medial malleolus?  
**A:** Grafts fail over bony prominences or tendon without paratenon. Flaps bring their own vascular supply.

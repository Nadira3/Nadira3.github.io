## I. Concept Digestion

### 1. Differentiation of Ulcer Types

| Feature              | Venous Ulcer                        | Arterial Ulcer                      | Lymphatic Ulcer                    | Malignant Ulcer                             |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Location             | Medial malleolus (gaiter area)      | Toes, heels, pressure points        | Dorsum of foot                      | Anywhere, esp. chronic ulcer sites           |
| Appearance           | Shallow, irregular, granulating     | Punched out, deep, necrotic         | Shallow, oozing                     | Raised, everted edges, necrotic base         |
| Pain                 | Mild, relieved by elevation         | Severe, worse on elevation          | Mild to moderate                    | Painless or neuropathic pain                 |
| Surrounding Skin     | Hemosiderin deposits, eczema        | Cold, hairless, shiny               | Thickened, hyperkeratotic          | Indurated, pigmented, satellite nodules      |
| Pulses               | Present                             | Absent/Reduced                      | Normal                              | May be normal or reduced                     |
| Discharge            | Serous or purulent                  | Minimal                             | Proteinaceous lymph                 | Bloody, foul-smelling                        |
| Other Signs          | Varicose veins                      | Claudication, rest pain, gangrene   | Lymphedema, peau d’orange          | Regional nodes, systemic signs               |

## III. Clinical/Applied Simulation – Consultant Round

> **Consultant:** "You’re reviewing a leg ulcer—defaulting to 'venous' without thinking? That’s amateur. Walk me through your reasoning. I’ll fail fluff."

**You (student):**
- **Pain**: Is it worse on walking (arterial) or relieved by elevation (venous)?
- **Location**: Medial ankle (venous) vs toes/heel (arterial)?
- **Edges**: Irregular = venous, punched out = arterial, everted = malignant.
- **Discharge**: Serous vs lymph-rich vs bloody/foul?
- **Pulses**: Check all – absent is arterial clue.
- **Systemic features**: Weight loss, fever? Think malignancy.

**Consultant:** "You missed ulcer age, prior trauma, neuropathy, and lymphadenopathy. You want to be a surgeon? Redo it in SOAP."

## IV. Neurofibromatosis

### Definition:
- **NF1 (von Recklinghausen)** – Chromosome 17 – Neurofibromin mutation.
- **NF2** – Chromosome 22 – Merlin mutation.

### Clinical Features of NF1:

| System       | Manifestation                                 |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Skin         | Café-au-lait spots (≥6), axillary freckling   |
| Neuro        | Seizures, learning disabilities               |
| Eye          | Lisch nodules (iris hamartomas)               |
| Tumors       | Neurofibromas (cutaneous/plexiform), gliomas |

## VI. Monitoring Skin Flap Viability

| Parameter         | Interpretation                                     |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Color             | Pink = good, Pale = ischemia, Blue = congestion    |
| Cap Refill        | Normal <2s, delayed = ischemia                     |
| Temperature       | Cool = ischemic, compare with adjacent skin        |
| Bleeding Edge     | Presence = good perfusion                          |
| Area of Discoloration | Progression = poor perfusion                    |

---

## VII. Why Not Graft Over Medial Malleolus?

- **Grafts require granulation tissue** – bone/tendon exposure = fail
- **Flaps bring their own blood supply**
- Better durability, contouring over pressure zones
- Higher success rates in ischemic or infected beds

---

## VIII. Why Use Hb, Not PCV, for Surgical Planning?

| Reason              | Explanation                                       |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Hb = O₂ carrying power | Direct measure of oxygen transport             |
| PCV misleads         | Affected by hydration status                    |
| Acute blood loss     | PCV lags behind, Hb reflects real deficit        |
| Volume status shift  | PCV rises with dehydration falsely              |

> **Consultant:** "Stop quoting PCV like it’s gospel. Hb tells you if your patient will bleed out or breathe post-op. PCV is for clerks, not surgeons."

## IX. Pre-Operative Investigations

| Test                 | Purpose                                          |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| FBC                  | Anemia, infection, platelet status              |
| U&E                  | Renal function, electrolytes                    |
| PT/INR/aPTT          | Bleeding risk                                   |
| HbA1c/RBS            | Glycemic control                                |
| ECG                  | Baseline rhythm, ischemic changes               |
| CXR                  | Pulmonary pathology, cardiomegaly               |
| Crossmatch           | Prepare for transfusion                         |

| Chest function tests | Indicated in COPD/asthma patients               |
| Imaging              | For ulcer depth, osteomyelitis, vascular supply |

# X. From History – Ruling Out Types of Ulcers

### Key Differentiating Questions:

| Ulcer Type     | Focused Questions                                                                 |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Venous**     | - Do your legs swell at the end of the day?  
                - Does elevating the leg relieve pain?  
                - History of varicose veins?  
                - Any brownish skin discoloration?  
| **Arterial**   | - Do you have leg pain when walking (claudication)?  
                - Is the pain worse at night or when legs are elevated?  
                - Do your feet feel cold or numb?  
                - Do you smoke or have diabetes/HTN?  
| **Lymphatic**  | - Do you have a long-standing swelling of the limb?  
                - Any history of recurrent cellulitis?  
                - Milky/clear discharge from the ulcer?  
                - Travel to filariasis-endemic areas?  
| **Malignant**  | - Has the ulcer been present for many years?  
                - Is the base of the ulcer bleeding or foul-smelling?  
                - Has it changed in size/appearance recently?  
                - Any nearby hard lumps (lymph nodes)?  

> **Red Flag Query:** Any **weight loss, fatigue, or family history of cancers**?

# XI. Simulation – The Angry Consultant

**Consultant:**  
"Why the hell would you say 'venous' without asking about claudication? If that patient has rest pain and you slap a compression bandage on them, you’re writing the amputation request. Again—what. specific. history. question. rules out malignancy?"

**Expected Student Response:**  
"Chronicity, foul discharge, and progressive change in size or bleeding are suspicious. Ask about lymphadenopathy, prior trauma, and systemic signs like weight loss."

**Consultant:**  
"Better. But if you don’t examine *pulses* and don’t biopsy a suspicious ulcer—you deserve your malpractice suit. Next!"

# XIII. Clinical Monitoring – Flap Post-Op Care

### Mnemonic: **"The FLAP CODE"**

| Code Letter | Meaning               | Explanation                                                 |
|-------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **F**       | **Flush of Color**     | Pink = good, Pale = ischemia, Dusky = venous congestion     |
| **L**       | **Local Temp**         | Compare with surrounding skin – cold = compromise           |
| **A**       | **Area of Discoloration** | Progressive darkening = early necrosis                   |
| **P**       | **Peripheral Bleeding** | Prick the edge – absence of bleeding = bad perfusion       |
| **C**       | **Capillary Refill**   | Normal <2s = viable                                         |
| **O**       | **Odor/Discharge**     | Foul smell = infection = decompensation                     |
| **D**       | **Doppler Signal**     | Confirm arterial inflow                                     |
| **E**       | **Edge Tension**       | Excess pressure = poor flow; flap too tight?                |

> **Consultant Warning:**  
“You lose a flap, you fail the rotation. I want round-the-clock charting. No guesswork.”

Case Study: Intussusception & Peritonitis Surgical Review

## 1. Features of Peritonitis

| Clinical Feature              | Pathophysiological Basis |
|------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **No movement with respiration** | Diaphragmatic splinting due to pain from inflamed peritoneum. |
| **Rigidity**                 | Reflex contraction of abdominal wall muscles in response to peritoneal irritation. |
| **Tenderness (generalized & rebound)** | Localized and generalized peritoneal inflammation; rebound from sudden release increases peritoneal stretch, triggering pain. |

---

## 2. When to Send Intussusception Patient to Surgery Without Imaging

| Clinical Scenario | Justification for Immediate Surgery |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Sausage-shaped mass + Peritonitis** | Suggests bowel ischemia or perforation → laparotomy is mandatory. No imaging delay. |

> **Branch-Off:** Peritonitis = Surgical Abdomen → Exploratory Laparotomy.  
> Imaging wastes precious time in unstable patients.

---

## 3. Post-Op Review Checklist

| Question | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| **Additional treatment needed?** | Adjuvant therapy, ongoing infection control, nutritional support |
| **Complications post-op?** | Early identification prevents escalation—bleeding, sepsis, DVT |
| **Has oral intake started?** | Marker of GI recovery (return of bowel function) |

---

## 4. Atelectasis – Pathophysiology Post-Op

- **Cause**: Anaesthesia → ↓ ciliary clearance, mucus plugging → ↓ surfactant → alveolar collapse.
- **Effect**: Hypoxia, especially in dependent lung zones.
- **Prevention**: Incentive spirometry, early ambulation, physiotherapy.

---

## 5. Postoperative Timeline of Expected Events

| Post-op Day | Expected Occurrence |
|-------------|----------------------|
| **Day 1–2** | Metabolic stress response: ↑ cortisol, catabolism, fluid shifts |
| **Day 3** | Atelectasis risk ↑ due to immobility, retained secretions |
| **Day 5–7** | Wound infection peaks |
| **Day 7+** | Anastomotic leak, DVT risk ↑ |

---

## 6. Dance Sign in Intussusception

- **What**: Empty Right Iliac Fossa
- **Why**: Terminal ileum invaginates into colon → vacated RIF.

---

## 7. Barium Enema in Intussusception

| Utility      | Explanation |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Diagnostic** | Shows “Coil spring” appearance |
| **Therapeutic** | Hydrostatic pressure may reduce intussusception |

### Alternate Non-Invasive Options
- **Soap + Water enema**
- **Saline Enema under USS**
- **Drawbacks**: Risk of perforation, delay in definitive care if failed.

---

## 8. Ultrasound Findings in Intussusception

| View          | Diagnostic Sign |
|---------------|------------------|
| **Transverse** | **Target sign / Doughnut sign** |
| **Longitudinal** | **Pseudokidney sign** |

---

## 9. Pathophysiology of Intussusception

- **Telescoping of bowel** → venous congestion → bowel wall edema → ischemia → gangrene
- Commonly triggered by **lymphoid hyperplasia** (e.g. post-viral infection in children)

---

## 10. Types of Intussusception

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Ileo-colic** | Most common in infants |
| **Ileo-ileal** | Less common |
| **Colo-colic** | Lead point often present (e.g., polyp, tumor) |
| **Retrograde** | Reversed direction of invagination |

---

## 11. Gangrenous Bowel = Significant Blood Loss – Why?

- **Friable, necrotic tissue** has inflamed, edematous, hypervascular borders.
- Resection leads to **massive capillary oozing**.
- Septic/coagulopathic patients bleed more.

---

## 12. Treatment of Intussusception

### Non-Operative Options

| Method | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| **Barium enema** | Radiologic + therapeutic |
| **Saline enema + USS** | Max 3 attempts; low risk if skilled |
| **Hydrostatic / Pneumatic reduction** | Pneumatic more effective, safer in some settings |

### Operative Management

- **Indications**: Peritonitis, failure of non-op, gangrene
- **Procedure**:
  - Attempt **manual reduction** (“milking”)
  - If unsuccessful or gangrenous: **Resection + primary end-to-end anastomosis**

## Consultant Challenge – Integration Task

> **Case:**  
> You’re the SHO. A 6-month-old presents with bilious vomiting, palpable mass, rigid abdomen.  
> You order an ultrasound. While waiting, vitals drop. Do you still wait?  
> When you take them to theatre, what anatomical layers do you anticipate during entry?  
> What factors can prevent successful reduction? Explain clearly.

## Consultant Challenge – Case Answer

### Case Recap:
- **Patient**: 6-month-old
- **Presentation**: Bilious vomiting, palpable sausage-shaped mass, rigid abdomen
- **Status**: Deteriorating vitals while awaiting ultrasound

### Stepwise Clinical Reasoning:

#### 1. Do you still wait for imaging?
**No.**  
- **Why**: Bilious vomiting + peritonitis signs + hemodynamic instability = **surgical abdomen**.
- **Ultrasound delay risks bowel necrosis, perforation, death.**
- **Action**: Expedite resuscitation → Call anesthesia → Proceed for **emergency laparotomy**.

---

#### 2. Anticipated Anatomical Layers During Laparotomy:
**Midline incision approach**

| Layer | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1. Skin | Subumbilical vertical incision |
| 2. Subcutaneous tissue | Camper’s + Scarpa’s fascia |
| 3. Linea alba | Midline fibrous structure |
| 4. Transversalis fascia | Thin layer above peritoneum |
| 5. Peritoneum | Entering the abdominal cavity |
| 6. Small bowel loops | Carefully inspected; seek intussuscepted segment |

---

#### 3. Factors Preventing Successful Manual Reduction

| Factor | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Bowel gangrene** | Fragile, non-viable; risks perforation if manipulated |
| **Tight lead point** | Tumor or Meckel’s diverticulum can act as an anchor |
| **Delayed presentation** | Edema, inflammation makes reduction unsafe |
| **Adhesions or anatomical abnormalities** | May prevent retrograde milking of intussusception |

### Q2: What sign on physical exam indicates intussusception with displaced bowel?
- **A:** Dance sign (Empty right iliac fossa)

### Q3: Why is barium enema both diagnostic and therapeutic?

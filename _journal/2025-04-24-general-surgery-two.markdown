### 1. Presentation & Initial Assessment  

#### A. History Taking


- Onset & Duration  
  
  - Acute: < 2 wks  
  
  - Subacute: 2â€“6 wks  
  
  - Chronic: > 6 wks (â‰¥ 4 wks in adults â†’ malignancy workup)  


- Growth Rate  
 
  - Rapid â†’ consider lymphoma, Riedelâ€™s thyroiditis  


- Associated Symptoms  
  
  - Local: dysphagia, dyspnea, hoarseness (RLN), pain (subacute thyroiditis)  
  
  - Systemic: fever, weight loss, night sweats (lymphoma, TB)  


- Thyroid Function Symptoms  
  
  - Palpitations, tremor, heat intolerance â€” absent here  


- Risk Factors & Exposures  
  
  - Prior neck irradiation, family history of thyroid cancer  


- Social Hx

  - Standing: 102 bpm (no orthostasis)  
  
  - Persistent tachycardia in euthyroid â†’ consider anxiety, anemia, POTS  


- Thyroid Function Tests  
  
  - TSH & Free Tâ‚„: normal â†’ euthyroid

- Indications:  
  
  - Temporary protection of distal anastomosis  
  
  - Palliative diversion with planned future reversal   
 
- Case:    
> 58-year-old woman postâ€“low anterior resection receives protective loop sigmoid colostomy to allow anastomotic healing  



#### Double-Barrel Colostomy


- Definition: Colon completely divided; both ends matured as separate stomas (proximal stool, distal mucus)  
  
- Indication: Decompression of distal bowel with future reconnection planned   
 
- Case:
> 45-year-old man with perforated diverticulitis and peritonitis â†’ transverse double-barrel colostomy for source control

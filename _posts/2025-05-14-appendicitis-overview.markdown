---

## SUMMARY  
**22-year-old male** with acute onset abdominal pain migrating from periumbilical to RIF, associated with anorexia, nausea, localized tenderness, and fever. No red flags for GI bleed, UTI, or testicular pathology. No prior similar episodes or medical conditions.

---

## EXAMINATION (VERBALIZED FINDINGS)

### General:
- Alert, uncomfortable, lying still with hips flexed  
- T: 38.2°C | HR: 98 bpm | BP: 118/72 | RR: 18 | SpO₂: 98% on room air  

### Abdomen:
- Inspection: Flat, no distension or surgical scars  
- Palpation:  
  - **Tenderness maximal at McBurney’s point**  
  - **Localized guarding** in RIF  
  - **Rebound tenderness** present  
  - Positive **Rovsing’s** and **psoas signs**  
- Percussion: Tenderness over RIF, no shifting dullness  
- Auscultation: Hypoactive bowel sounds  

### Hernial orifices: Normal  
### Testes: Normal lie, no tenderness  
### PR: Deferred (no signs indicating need)

---

## DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS (with justification)

1. **Acute appendicitis** — classical migratory pain, RIF tenderness, systemic inflammation.
2. **Mesenteric adenitis** — possible mimic in young patients, but less likely with migration and peritoneal signs.
3. **Meckel’s diverticulitis** — anatomical mimic, but rare; consider if imaging negative for appendicitis.
4. **Early Crohn’s disease** — chronicity and systemic features absent.
5. **Renal colic** — no flank pain, hematuria or radiation.
6. **Testicular torsion** — ruled out clinically.

---

## INVESTIGATIONS

**Bedside:**
- Urinalysis – exclude UTI  
- Pregnancy test – *not applicable here* but **mandatory in females** with abdominal pain  
- ECG – if abdominal pain atypical or older age

**Bloods:**
- **FBC** – expect leukocytosis with neutrophilia  
- **CRP/ESR** – elevated inflammatory markers  
- **U&E** – assess dehydration, pre-op workup  
- **LFT/amylase** – exclude hepatobiliary or pancreatic cause if RUQ/epigastric symptoms present  

**Imaging:**
- **Ultrasound abdomen** – first-line in lean males; operator-dependent  
- **CT abdomen with contrast** – if diagnosis uncertain or atypical features  
  > Note: In young adults, clinical diagnosis often sufficient to proceed to theatre

---

## ALVARADO SCORE  
- Migratory pain: +1  
- Anorexia: +1  
- Nausea/vomiting: +1  
- Tenderness in RIF: +2  
- Rebound: +1  
- Temp >37.5°C: +1  
- Leukocytosis: +2 (pending)

**= 7/10 → High probability → surgical referral**

---

## MANAGEMENT PLAN

1. **NPO** – strict nil per os  
2. **IV access** – wide-bore cannula ×2  
3. **IV fluids** – 0.9% saline bolus (dehydrated)  
4. **IV antibiotics** – e.g., **Ceftriaxone + Metronidazole** per hospital protocol  
5. **Analgesia** – IV paracetamol ± morphine  
6. **Surgical review** – urgent; appendectomy indicated unless imaging contradicts  
7. **Pre-op labs & consent** – including group & save, clotting  
8. **Observation** – monitor vitals 4-hourly, reassess if worsening  
9. **Escalation plan** – if perforated/peritonitis suspected → resuscitate + urgent laparotomy

---

## REFLECTION

> “This is a high-probability case of appendicitis in a young male with textbook evolution of symptoms. While imaging may be helpful in equivocal cases, I would not delay surgical referral in the presence of localized peritonism and classic clinical signs.”

---

## CONSULTANT-LEVEL NOTES

- Watch for atypical presentations (retrocecal, pelvic)  
- Always examine **testes** in lower quadrant pain  
- Don’t fixate on CT when the diagnosis is **clinically evident**  
- Pre-empt **complications** — perforation, abscess, ileus  
- Think **escalation, decision timelines**, and **post-op care**

- No rashes, joint pains  

---

## SUMMARY  
**19-year-old female** with 18-hour history of abdominal pain migrating to the RIF, associated with anorexia and mild fever. Denies significant gynecologic or urinary symptoms, but **appendicitis vs ovarian pathology remains key differential**.

---

## EXAMINATION (VERBALIZED FINDINGS)

### General:
- Alert, lying still, appears uncomfortable  
- T: 37.8°C | HR: 94 bpm | BP: 116/70 | RR: 18 | SpO₂: 99% RA  

### Abdomen:
- Inspection: Flat, no distension, no scars  
- Palpation:  
  - **RIF tenderness and guarding**  
  - **No rebound tenderness**  
  - **Rovsing’s sign** negative  
  - **Psoas sign** equivocal  
- Percussion: Mild localized tenderness  
- Auscultation: Normal bowel sounds  

### Pelvic exam (verbalized only):  
- No cervical motion tenderness  
- No adnexal tenderness or masses  
- No vaginal discharge  

### PR: Deferred  
### Urinalysis: Trace leukocytes, negative nitrites  
### Pregnancy test (urine): **Negative**

---

## DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

1. **Acute appendicitis** – classic migratory pain, RIF tenderness, systemic inflammation.  
2. **Ovarian torsion** – lower quadrant pain in a young woman; ruled out clinically due to absence of adnexal mass or severe tenderness on pelvic exam.  
3. **Mittelschmerz** – mid-cycle ovulation pain, typically milder, no systemic signs.  
4. **Ectopic pregnancy** – ruled out by **negative pregnancy test**.  
5. **PID** – ruled out by absence of discharge, dyspareunia, or cervical motion tenderness.  
6. **UTI** – mild urinary frequency present, but **no dysuria**, no significant findings on urinalysis.

---

## INVESTIGATIONS

**Bedside:**
- Urinalysis – done  
- Pregnancy test – negative  
- ECG – if doubt about cardiac causes (not indicated here)  

**Bloods:**
- FBC – check WBC count  
- CRP – assess inflammation  
- U&E – pre-op screen  
- LFTs, amylase – if upper abdominal symptoms emerge

**Imaging:**
- **Transabdominal pelvic ultrasound** – evaluate ovaries, exclude torsion or cyst  
- **Abdominal US/CT** – if diagnosis remains uncertain after pelvic scan  
  > **Note:** Avoid CT unless US is inconclusive; radiation risk in young female

---

## ALVARADO SCORE  
- Migratory pain: +1  
- Anorexia: +1  
- Nausea: +1  
- RIF tenderness: +2  
- Fever >37.5°C: +1  
- WBC: pending

**= At least 6/10 → moderate to high risk**

---

## MANAGEMENT PLAN

1. **NPO**  
2. **IV access ×2**  
3. **Fluids:** Normal saline bolus  
4. **Analgesia:** IV paracetamol + consider morphine  
5. **IV antibiotics:** Ceftriaxone + Metronidazole  
6. **Gynae consult for pelvic US**  
7. **Surgical review** – early referral once torsion and ectopic ruled out  
8. **Consent and pre-op bloods**  
9. **Observation:** Vitals q4h, monitor for clinical deterioration

---

## REFLECTION

> “In a reproductive-age female, **pelvic pathology must always be ruled out** before labeling abdominal pain as appendicitis. Here, the clinical picture leans toward appendicitis, but a pelvic ultrasound is necessary to exclude ovarian torsion or a hemorrhagic cyst before surgical intervention.”

---

## CONSULTANT NOTES

- In women <40, never skip a **pregnancy test**  
- Always consider **gynae pathology** in RIF pain  
- CT is a **last resort** — preserve fertility, avoid over-radiation  
- Communicate early with **gynae + surgery** in unclear cases  
- Appendectomy can proceed once alternate diagnoses are reasonably excluded

---

## ALLERGIES  
- NKDA

---

## FAMILY HISTORY  
- Non-contributory

---

## SOCIAL HISTORY  
- Retired accountant  
- Lives with wife  
- Smokes occasionally (5 pack-year history)  
- Alcohol: rare social use  
- Independent in ADLs  

---

## SYSTEMIC REVIEW  
- No chest pain or dyspnea  
- No cough or hemoptysis  
- No recent weight loss  
- No rashes or joint pain  
- No neurological deficits  

---

## SUMMARY  
**74-year-old diabetic male** with 3-day history of generalized → RIF abdominal pain, anorexia, and low-grade fever. Concerned for **atypical appendicitis or intra-abdominal sepsis**. High risk of perforation and delayed presentation.

---

## EXAMINATION (VERBALIZED FINDINGS)

### General:
- Elderly, appears tired but not septic  
- T: 38.3°C | HR: 102 bpm | BP: 118/68 | RR: 22 | SpO₂: 97% RA  

### Abdomen:
- Inspection: Mildly distended, no visible peristalsis  
- Palpation:  
  - Diffuse lower abdominal tenderness  
  - **Localized guarding in RIF**  
  - Mild rebound tenderness  
- Percussion: Mild tympany  
- Bowel sounds: Hypoactive  

### PR:
- Empty rectum  
- No masses or bleeding  

---

## DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

1. **Acute appendicitis with delayed presentation** – consistent with RIF signs, systemic symptoms  
2. **Diverticulitis (right-sided or caecal)** – possible in elderly with no prior diagnosis  
3. **Perforated viscus** – especially in diabetics; consider imaging urgently  
4. **Colonic carcinoma with subacute obstruction** – vague symptoms, constitutional features  
5. **Mesenteric ischemia** – needs to be ruled out; pain is usually out of proportion to findings  
6. **UTI or prostatitis** – less likely due to absence of dysuria, but worth screening  

---

## INVESTIGATIONS

**Bedside:**
- ECG – baseline  
- Urinalysis – to exclude infection  
- Blood glucose – capillary + serum  
- ABG – assess for lactic acidosis if septic  
- VBG – lactate, glucose  

**Bloods:**
- FBC – likely leukocytosis  
- CRP – inflammatory marker  
- U&E – renal function  
- LFTs, amylase  
- Blood cultures – if febrile  
- Group and save + clotting screen  

**Imaging:**
- **Erect CXR** – rule out free air  
- **Abdominal CT with contrast** – gold standard in elderly with suspected intra-abdominal infection  
  > Consider risk of contrast in diabetic patients – assess renal function first

---

## MANAGEMENT PLAN

1. **NPO**  
2. **IV fluids:** Start resuscitation (e.g., NS 500 mL bolus)  
3. **IV access ×2**  
4. **Empirical antibiotics:** IV Ceftriaxone + Metronidazole  
5. **Analgesia:** Paracetamol ± cautious opioids  
6. **Surgical consult:** For urgent review  
7. **CT abdomen/pelvis:** Priority – to confirm diagnosis and assess for perforation or abscess  
8. **Monitor vitals and urine output closely**  
9. **Consider DVT prophylaxis**  
10. **Diabetic management:** Adjust insulin/sliding scale if necessary  
11. **Consent for surgery if diagnosis confirmed**

---

## KEY POINTS FOR CONSULTANT REVIEW

- Elderly patients have **blunted inflammatory responses**  
- High risk of **late or complicated appendicitis**  
- Imaging is **mandatory** – do **not rely on clinical judgment alone**  
- Mortality increases with perforation – be proactive  
- Always exclude **malignancy, ischemia, diverticulitis** in elderly abdominals  
- Initiate **early sepsis treatment bundle** if criteria met

---

## REFLECTION

> “Appendicitis is often missed in the elderly due to vague symptoms and muted signs. This case requires a **high index of suspicion**, **urgent imaging**, and a **broad differential** approach to avoid delay in treatment and poor outcomes.”

- **Denies previous similar episodes**  
- **Denies trauma or recent foreign travel**

---

## PAST MEDICAL HISTORY  
- No known chronic illnesses  
- No previous abdominal surgeries  
- Fully vaccinated

---

## DRUG HISTORY  
- Nil regular medications  
- No recent antibiotics or NSAID use  
- No anticoagulants or steroids  

---

## ALLERGIES  
- None known  

---

## FAMILY HISTORY  
- Non-contributory

---

## SOCIAL HISTORY  
- University student, lives in hostel  
- No smoking, no alcohol or drug use  
- No recent sick contacts

---

## SYSTEMIC REVIEW  
- No weight loss, jaundice, or rashes  
- No neck stiffness, photophobia, or headache  
- No urinary symptoms  
- No recent respiratory or ENT infections  

---

## SUMMARY  
**23-year-old previously well male** with acute-onset abdominal pain that migrated to RIF and became generalized, associated with fever, vomiting, and abdominal rigidity. High suspicion of **perforated appendicitis with generalized peritonitis**.

---

## EXAMINATION (VERBALIZED FINDINGS)

### General:
- Ill-looking, lying still  
- Diaphoretic, shallow breathing  
- T: 38.9°C | HR: 126 bpm | BP: 98/62 | RR: 28 | SpO₂: 96% RA  

### Abdomen:
- Inspection: Abdominal wall guarding, minimal movement  
- Palpation:  
  - **Generalized severe tenderness**, maximal in RIF  
  - **Board-like rigidity**  
  - **Rebound tenderness present throughout**  
- Percussion: Diffuse tenderness, some dullness in flanks  
- Auscultation: Absent bowel sounds  

### PR:
- Empty rectum  
- No blood or masses  

---

## DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

**Primary:**  
1. **Perforated appendicitis** → severe generalized peritonitis  
2. **Perforated peptic ulcer** → less likely (no NSAID history, pain pattern less epigastric)  
3. **Mesenteric ischemia** → rare at this age, but severe pain raises concern  
4. **Ruptured Meckel's diverticulum** → important mimic in young adults  
5. **Torsion of intra-abdominal organ (ovarian/testicular)** → not applicable here  

---

## INVESTIGATIONS

**Bedside:**  
- ECG  
- Capillary glucose  
- ABG – likely metabolic acidosis with raised lactate  
- Urinalysis  
- Pregnancy test – N/A (if female)

**Bloods:**  
- FBC – raised WBC, neutrophilia  
- CRP – markedly elevated  
- U&E – assess dehydration, electrolyte derangement  
- LFTs, amylase – exclude hepatobiliary/pancreatic pathology  
- Crossmatch 4 units  
- Coagulation screen  
- Blood cultures ×2  

**Imaging:**  
- **Erect CXR** – look for free air under diaphragm  
- **Urgent abdominal CT with contrast** – confirms perforation, extent of contamination  

---

## DIAGNOSIS  
> **Perforated appendicitis with generalized peritonitis and early sepsis**.

---

## MANAGEMENT PLAN

1. **ABC + Resuscitation**
   - Oxygen 15L non-rebreather  
   - 2 large-bore IV cannulas  
   - IV fluids: 1L bolus NS, reassess after each  
   - Monitor HR, BP, UO hourly  

2. **IV Antibiotics (STAT)**
   - Triple therapy: IV Ceftriaxone + Metronidazole ± Gentamicin (or as per local policy)  

3. **Analgesia**
   - IV paracetamol ± cautious morphine after surgical consult  

4. **Nil by mouth**  
   - NG tube if vomiting persists or bowel obstruction suspected  
   - Urinary catheter for strict input/output monitoring  

5. **Surgical Team – URGENT Review**
   - Laparotomy/laparoscopy likely  
   - Discuss with consultant on-call  
   - Pre-op labs and ECG  

6. **Consent for Surgery** (if stable)  
7. **Inform theatre team** – possible emergency laparotomy  
8. **Sepsis Six bundle** within 1 hour  

---

## RED FLAGS / CONSULTANT EXPECTATIONS

- **Perforated appendix = surgical emergency**  
- Don’t delay imaging **if it would delay surgery** – decision is clinical  
- Beware **silent abdomen with high pain** – impending sepsis  
- Fluid resuscitation is **as critical as antibiotics**  
- CT may confirm, but do **not delay referral to surgical team** for imaging  

---

## REFLECTION

> “In suspected perforation, act fast. Clinical signs override waiting for labs or imaging. Time to theatre saves lives — this is where diagnosis must be decisive, and delays are deadly.”

| **Complications**               | Early appendicitis                               | High risk of perforation or abscess                  | Confirmed perforation and peritonitis              |
| **Differential Diagnosis**      | Ovarian torsion, PID, ectopic                    | Diverticulitis, malignancy, AAA                     | Perforated ulcer, Meckel’s, mesenteric ischemia    |
| **Investigations Priority**     | Rule out gyn causes, pelvic US                   | CT abdomen often required to localize pathology      | ABG, erect CXR, urgent CT if unclear               |
| **Management Approach**         | IV antibiotics + diagnostic imaging              | Broad-spectrum ABX, early surgical consult           | Emergency resus + surgical referral + ABX          |
| **Surgical Urgency**            | Semi-urgent (after imaging)                      | High suspicion: do not delay for imaging             | Emergency laparotomy indicated                     |
| **Teaching Point**              | Think pelvic pathology in young females          | Elderly have blunted inflammatory response           | Diagnosis is **clinical**; delays increase mortality |

## Clinical Reasoning Table – Appendicitis Symptom Analysis

| Symptom / Sign           | Etiology / Pathophysiology                                                                 | Clinical Interpretation                                                                 | Complications If Missed                              | Associated Exam Findings                          |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Periumbilical pain**   | Visceral innervation of midgut (T10) → vague, poorly localized                             | Early appendicitis – inflamed appendix irritates visceral peritoneum                    | Delayed diagnosis if misattributed to gastroenteritis | Normal or mild tenderness on deep palpation        |
| **Pain migration to RIF**| Inflammation extends to parietal peritoneum → somatic innervation localizes pain           | Hallmark of classic appendicitis                                                         | Missed opportunity for early diagnosis                | Localized guarding, McBurney’s point tenderness    |
| **Generalized pain**     | Peritoneal contamination after perforation                                                 | Suggests rupture and diffuse peritonitis                                                | Septic shock, abscess formation                       | Board-like rigidity, rebound, absent bowel sounds  |
| **Anorexia**             | CNS-mediated response to inflammation, vagal activation                                    | One of the earliest symptoms in appendicitis                                             | Missed in elderly or subtle presentations             | Not directly exam-detectable                       |
| **Nausea & vomiting**    | Visceral irritation, ileus, or later bowel obstruction                                     | Common but non-specific. Vomiting usually **after** pain onset                          | Persistent vomiting = concern for perforation         | Dehydration, epigastric tenderness (early)         |
| **Fever**                | Cytokine release due to inflammation → hypothalamic set point change                       | Low-grade in simple appendicitis; high-grade suggests perforation or abscess            | Sepsis, delayed surgical referral                     | Warm peripheries early, cool clammy in late sepsis |
| **Tachycardia**          | Systemic inflammatory response or dehydration                                              | Marker of systemic involvement, early SIRS                                               | Precursor to shock                                    | Rapid pulse, hypotension in late stages            |
| **Guarding**             | Reflex muscle contraction due to peritoneal irritation                                     | Indicates local peritonitis (early) or generalized peritonitis (late)                   | Missed guarding → missed surgical belly               | Voluntary (early) or involuntary (advanced)        |
| **Rebound tenderness**   | Pain from sudden release of pressure = peritoneal stretch                                  | High specificity for peritonitis                                                         | Suggests progression beyond mucosal inflammation      | Positive Rovsing’s or McBurney’s sign              |
| **Silent abdomen**       | Paralytic ileus from widespread inflammation                                               | Seen in late/perforated cases                                                            | Indicates bowel shutdown, risk of perforation         | No bowel sounds, distension                        |
| **Absent fever in elderly**| Blunted immune response                                                                  | Atypical; don’t rely on fever for diagnosis in elderly                                  | Missed or delayed diagnosis, higher mortality         | May appear well despite serious pathology          |
| **Right-sided rectal tenderness**| Inflamed appendix irritating posterior peritoneum or pelvic structures         | Especially in retrocecal or pelvic appendix                                              | Overlooked if PR not done when indicated              | Tenderness on DRE                                 |
| **Diarrhea or urinary symptoms**| Pelvic appendix irritates rectum/bladder                                         | May mimic UTI or gastroenteritis                                                        | Incorrect diagnosis → wrong management                | Suprapubic or pelvic tenderness                    |
| **Severe abdominal rigidity**| Diffuse peritonitis and muscle spasm due to chemical irritation                      | Classic of perforation or ruptured viscera                                               | Indicates urgent surgical need                        | Board-like abdomen                                 |
| **Hypotension**          | Sepsis-induced vasodilation or fluid loss from third spacing                              | Pre-terminal sign unless addressed rapidly                                               | Septic shock                                          | Delayed cap refill, cool peripheries               |
